# Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

### APPRENTICE

 This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased. 


### Solution

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter. 

2. Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+OR+1=1--

3. Submit the request, and verify that the response now contains additional items.
